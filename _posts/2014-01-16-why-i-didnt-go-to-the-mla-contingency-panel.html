<p>I saw it in the program, thought, "that looks really important, I should go to that."</p>
<p>But then I noticed it was scheduled near dinner, and we were supposed to go to that Mexican place everyone was talking about, with the hot chocolate.</p>
<p>And I thought, "well <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect">someone else will go</a>."</p>
<p>"I'm not very important, I won't be missed."</p>
<p>"Someone will tweet it and there will be a storify and I can catch up."</p>
<p>So I didn't go.</p>
<p>This is just a note to express my regret.</p>
<p>And to try to shame myself into learning for next time.</p>
