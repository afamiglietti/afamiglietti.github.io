title: "Web Peer Production Timeline"

A brief timeline of some important events in the history of peer production on the web (sort of, really the larger 21st century web), just so I can keep the chronology straight for myself. I've assembled this as part of prep for an article on the history of Wikipedia, so events I think of as connected to Wikipedia's emergence are privileged.

This is a note-to-self sort of thing. I constructed it idiosyncratically, remembering things that seemed important at the time and snowballing from there. It's not meant to be exhaustive or representative.
