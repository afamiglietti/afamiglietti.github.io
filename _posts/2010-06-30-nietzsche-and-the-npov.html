<p>Wikipedia's Neutral Point of view is, understandably, a controversial thing in some circles. I'm still investigating what the actual impact of the NPOV is, and I think its effects are actually complicated. However, I think some people are getting hung up on the word "Neutral," which may imply a sort of "objectivity" that they find distasteful. Namely, a vision of objective knowledge that is "neutral" because it is "pure," somehow detached from the messy world of politics and subjectivity we live in. This critique of the NPOV, I think, is a mistake. I'm not the only one to make this argument, Wikipedians themselves make it in their FAQ for the NPOV, and <a href="http://reagle.org/joseph/blog/">Joe Reagle</a> has made it as well.</p>
<p>Nietzsche, in <em>The Geneology of Morals </em>makes a critique of the notion of "pure reason" or "knowledge in itself," not dissimilar, I think, to the criticism that is sometimes leveled at the NPOV. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is <em>only</em> a perspective seeing, <em>only</em> a perspective "knowing"; and the <em>more</em> affects we allow to speak about one thing, the <em>more</em> eyes, different eyes, we can use to observe one thing, the more complete will our "concept" of this thing, our "objectivity," be.</p></blockquote>
<p>I couldn't help but be struck by how <em>similar </em>Nietzsche's call for an "objectivity" based on a multitude of perspectives is to the NPOV itself! One section of the policy reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>[The NPOV] is not a <em>lack</em> of viewpoint, but is rather an <em>editorially  neutral</em> point of view. An article and its sub-articles should clearly describe, represent, and characterize all the disputes  within a topic, but should not endorse any particular point of view. It  should explain who believes what, and why, and which points of view are  most common.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, this proves nothing about how the NPOV is actually employed in practice, which is considerably more complicated. Still, I think it makes for an interesting comparison.</p>
