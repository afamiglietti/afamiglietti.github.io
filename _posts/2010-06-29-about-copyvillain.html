<p style="text-align: left;">Hello! And welcome to the blog!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here on Copyvillain, I hope to work toward a crtical examination of what's  called been called Free Culture,  Peer-to-Peer culture, or Peer  Production. Basically, all of these terms  refer to the mode of  producing culture that we find on Wikipedia, in  which many loosely  organized collaborators work together to produce a  larger text without a  strictly hierarchical organization.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I  think it is important to explain what I mean when I say I intend  to  take a "critical" take on this method of production on this blog. I  do  not come here to bury Wikipedia (or YouTube, or Hacker spaces, or  what  have you). These are some of my favorite things. I think that  these  projects, and the people involved with them, are often animated  by a  tremendous idealism, and a wonderful sense that they are working   together to build a better future for all of humanity.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think that idealism is real, in fact I'm banking on it. What I'd  like to do  here is to argue that some of the cultural assumptions Peer  Production  brings with it from capitalism may serve to undercut the  very idealistic  goals that its practitioners embrace. My hope is that  their genuine  commitment to a better, fairer, human future will  motivate them to move  away from these assumptions and towards a new  vision for Peer Production  based on a broader understanding of human  equality and shared  responsibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of course, I'll also be posting some short write ups on current news, just keeping abreast of things.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Stay tuned!</p>
