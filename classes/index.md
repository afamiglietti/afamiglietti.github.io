      <h3>Com 201: Communications Ethics</h3>
      What does the rise of the digital network mean for human values? This is the key question this course will explore. As we will see, our values are neither controlled by this network, nor left alone by it. Instead, values and technology interact in complex ways that can produce opportunities for various forms of social good as well as risks for various forms of social harm.

      <h3>Com 473: Critical Hacking and Making</h3>
      This class is about both learning and engaging with the history and politics. We will learn to use Hacker/Maker derived technologies, like the Arduino microcontroller and 3d printers, and we will learn about the cultural values Hackers tried to "bake in" to these technologies. To better understand the cultural values at play, we will investigate the history of Hacker culture. Our class will read some case studies of Hacker/Maker projects that have tried to use technology to shape social change. Finally, we will work together as a class to build our own Hacker/Maker techno-social project.
