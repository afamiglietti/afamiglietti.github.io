### Goals:
The technology of care assignment asks students to _imagine_ a technological device that embodies the values of the ethics of care, and then present this device to the class. Doing so will help the students learn how values are embedded in technologies, give them an opportunity to think creatively about the potential for social and technological change, and practice their presentation skills.

### Instructions:

Working together in small groups, think of a technology that would embody the values of the Ethics of Care, much as Wikipedia embodies the values of Habermas's Discourse Ethics. This technology can be anything you wish, but should meet the following criteria:

* The device should somehow have the values of the ethics of care built into it's structure and functions. It should have features that concretely reflect these values.
* The device should attempt to address one ethical dilemma or problem we have discussed in this class.
* The device should employ digital communications technology in some way.
* The device should be technologically plausible. That is to say, you do not need to determine if it would actually work as designed (you're not engineers), but the design should not require magic to function, or break any obvious physical principles (i.e. no weightless devices, no perpetual motion machines).

Once you have designed your imaginary technology, you will present this technology to the class. To do this, prepare a 5-10 minute presentation on your technology to be delivered to the class during our meeting __Monday, November 9__. This presentation must:

* Employ powerpoint slides or a similar visual aide (including a representation of the technology itself)
* Explain _what_ your technology is
* Explain _how_ your technology's features embody the values of the ethics of care
* Explain _why_ your technology is a good way to address to one ethical dilemma discussed during class
* Involve all of your group members

### Evaluation:  
Your presentations will be evaluated according to the following rubric:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Criteria</th>
<th align="left">Excellent</th>
<th align="left">Good</th>
<th align="left">Acceptable</th>
<th align="left">Unacceptable</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><strong>Creativity</strong></td>
<td align="left">The group's presentation shows a technology that represents a really creative, original, or unexpected approach to the ethics of care, while still remaining technologically plausible.</td>
<td align="left">The group's presentation shows a technology that demonstrates some creativity, but is perhaps less than completely plausible, or seems otherwise incompletely thought-out.</td>
<td align="left">The group's presentation shows a technology that is highly derivative of existing devices, and shows little creative or original thinking.</td>
<td align="left">The group's presentation shows a technology that they did not, in fact, imagine, but rather simply copied from another source.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><strong>Evidence</strong></td>
<td align="left">The group uses specific references our reading on the ethics of care and the ethical dilemma being discussed in support of their technology argument. The evidence selected is clearly connected to the argument being made and logically incorporated the presentation. The evidence selected demonstrates the group&#8217;s mastery of class concepts.</td>
<td align="left">The group uses specific references our reading on the ethics of care and the ethical dilemma being discussed in support of their technology argument. However, this evidence is incorporated in a clumsy manner that fails to make clear connections to the group&#8217;s technology.</td>
<td align="left">The group attempts to use evidence from the class readings, but this attempt is not fully successful. The group may have failed to integrate the evidence into their presentation, fundamentally misunderstood class readings or misquoted the author.</td>
<td align="left">The group fails to utilize specific evidence from the class reading in their presentation.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><strong>Style</strong></td>
<td align="left">The group speaks clearly, at an even pace, and makes eye contact with the audience. The visuals presented add significantly to the audience's experience.</td>
<td align="left">The group speaks clearly, but they may sometimes be rushed or lack nonverbal cues that show attention to the audience. The visuals presented add significantly to the audience's experience.</td>
<td align="left">The group speaks in a way that makes it challenging for the audience to understand them OR the visuals do not contribute to the presentation in a meaningful way.</td>
<td align="left">The group seems totally unprepared to speak to the class OR the visual aide is totally absent.</td>
