### Goals:
The goal of the Wikipedia observation assignment is to help students learn about the ethics of online collaboration by studying the practices of Wikipedia editors. Students will watch some controversial Wikipedia articles and analyze the behavior of Wikipedia editors working on these articles using the frame of Habermas's Discourse Ethics.

### Instructions:
The Wikipedia assignment is divided into two parts. First, students will create a _watchlist_ of active Wikipedia discussions and articles and monitor these over a one-week period, taking notes as they go. Second, students will write a short (750-1000 word) essay comparing the behavior of Wikipedia editors to Habermas's Discourse Ethics.

#### Watchlist and Observation
Working together in with the instructor in class, students will build a watchlist of four active Wikipedia discussions or articles. The student will then monitor these articles for a one week period. For each of the three class meetings during this week, the student should include notes on the watchlist articles in his or her class notes. These notes should summarize recent developments in the article and its discussion page. Note the positions taken by various editors, the ways in which these editors support their positions, and the response to these positions by other editors.

#### Essay
At the close of the observation period each student will compose a short (750-1000 word) essay comparing the behavior of Wikipedia Editors, as they observed it, to Habermas's discourse ethics. This should be an argumentative essay, beginning with a thesis and supporting that thesis with reasoning and evidence. _If you are unsure of how to compose such an essay, make an appointment with the writing center right away._

Your essay should present and defend your own answer to the question: "How does the behavior of Wikipedia Editors, as you observed it, compare to the ideals of Habermas's Discourse Ethics?" However, since this is a complex question, here are some more concrete questions you can use as you are thinking about the problem. _The questions below are provided here as a starting point for your thinking. Your essay should NOT mechanically answer these questions._

* How do Wikipedia editors demonstrate that they are working together on a shared project?
* In what ways do Wikipedia editors show the opinions of other editors respect? In what ways might they not show them respect?
* How might Wikipedia editors engage in individual strategic action? How do other editors respond to this?
* How does Wikipedia compare to the Ideal Speech Situation described by Habermas?
* Where did you see Wikipedia editors engage in discussion about the rules of Wikipedia?

### Evaluation:  
Your essay will be evaluated based on the rubric below:
