### Goals:
This assignment will give the student experience in using HTML and CSS to build a simple website from scratch. The experience of scratch building a site will help students master the HTML and CSS syntax, and will reinforce their understanding of the basic structure of file systems and websites.

### Instructions:
Students will be given a collection of plain text and image files. These files represent the content of a business website for an imaginary food-truck. The student must build a website for this imaginary food-truck that meets the following criteria:

* The site must consist of a minimum of 3 linked HTML pages
* The site must use CSS styling information contained in an external stylesheet
* The site's HTML must [validate](https://html5.validator.nu/)
* The site must integrate all of the images provided by the instructor
* The site must provide clear visual cues to clearly direct the user to the site's navigation elements
* The site must use a consistent layout to group related content into visually distinct clusters
* The site must use color, font, size, and spacing choices to distinguish itself from the default stylesheet
* The site must use color, font, size, and spacing choices to convey an appropriate mood for the given content  

### Evaluation:
The HTML/CSS Assignment will be evaluated according to the following rubric:

|Criteria:|Excellent|Good|Satisfactory|Needs Improvement|
|---------|---------|----|------------|-----------------|
|__Technical correctness:__  |The site's HTML validates without any errors. The site's CSS is error free. The site uses semantic elements (nav rather than div, em rather than i, etc.).|The site's HTML validates without any errors. The site's CSS is error free.|The site's HTML validates without any errors. The CSS may contain small errors that do not impede the overall design.|The site's HTML does not validate. The site's CSS is absent, not located in an external stylesheet, or contains signifigant errors that impede site use.|
|__Design Consistency:__| The site has uses consistent navigation elements and visual hierarchy symbols across all of its pages. The design uses a consistent layout without any "jumps." The site aligns elements in a consistent way, ensuring most elements share a veritcal or horizontal line with related elements.|The site uses consistent navigation elements across all of its pages, and uses a consistent layout without any "jumps." Some small inconsistencies in visual hierarchy markers, and some sloppy margins, may be present.|The site uses a consistent layout across all of it's pages, but navigation elements are not consistently marked, or margins are consistently sloppy.|The site does not attempt to maintain a consistent design across all of its pages.|
|__Design Uniqueness:__| The site uses unique color, font, and layout choices. The site's design is visually distinctive, and sets an appropriate mood for the given content.| The site's design sets an appropriate mood for the given content, and makes an attempt to distinguish itself from similar sites, but is not really distinctive.| The site's design conveys an appropriate mood, but is clearly derivative of frequently used templates and does not distinguish itself.|The site's design is not appropriate to the given content.|
