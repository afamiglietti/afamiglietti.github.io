### Goals:
The goal of the portfolio assignment is to allow students to reflect on their progress over the semester and discuss what they have learned in each of our assignments.

### Instructions:
Review each of our three major assignments: the HTML/CSS project (food truck site), the Wordpress project, and the Jekyll project. For each project write a brief (300-600 word) reflection addressing the questions below. Do not respond to each question in turn, rather, consider the questions and then compose a 2-3 paragraph response for each assignment. Compile your reflections in a single document (word document, open office document, or pdf) and submit them to Blackboard.

#### Reflection Questions:
* What are you happy with in your design for this assignment?
* What would you change about this design, if you had to do it over again?
* How did your design skills improve, change, or evolve in this assignment, compared to your previous work?
* What do you remember as particularly challenging or frustrating about this assignment?

### Evaluation:
