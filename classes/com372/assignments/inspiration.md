### Goals:
The goal of the inspiration notebook is to build student knowledge of web design, and to provide them with a collection of high-quality design examples they can draw on as they build their own projects.

### Instructions:
Students will need to collect four examples of web design they find inspiring, and write up a short (300-500 word) document explaining why they believe each example to be a well designed web page. I have provided questions to guide your composition of each short response document. Your response document should also include the name of the website and a link to the website.

I _strongly recommend_ that students spend some time finding good, unique examples for their inspiration notebooks. Investing the time to find well-designed and distinctive sites for this assignment vastly improves the student's chances of producing well-designed and distinctive work of their own. The more variety you expose yourself to as you research your examples, the greater the palette of design options you will have at your disposal later on.

#### Inspiration Notebook Entry 1 (Due February 12)
This inspiration notebook entry focuses on the principle of _proximity_. Try to select a site that makes particularly striking use of this principle. For your response, answer the following questions:

* Name three distinct visual groupings that occur on this page and explain how these groupings convey meaning to the reader. In other words, what are three columns, boxes, or other groups set apart from the rest of the page by whitespace? Why has the author
* How does the site use proximity to convey _visual hierarchy_? How have important pieces of information been moved away from "clutter" to make them stand out? Why do you think these elements were selected by the designer to stand out?
* Name one thing this site does related to proximity that you might want to borrow for your own design, and explain why.

#### Inspiration Notebook Entry 2 (Due February 19)
This notebook entry focuses on the principle of _alignment_. Try to select a site that makes particularly striking use of this principle. For your response, answer the following questions:

* Imagine a ruler being passed over the page both vertically and horizontally (if you wish, get a real ruler or fold a piece of paper and try it out for real). As the ruler passes over the page, what page elements does it connect on a shared vertical or horizontal line? How do these lines link related pieces of information, or help to unify the page composition?
* What strong vertical or horizontal lines (for example: image borders or text margins) does the design emphasize? How does it use these lines to draw the reader's eye?
* Name one thing this site does related to _alignment_ that you might want to borrow for your own design, and explain why.

#### Inspiration Notebook Entry 3 (Due March 2)
This notebook entry focuses on the principle of _repetition_. Try to select a site that makes particularly striking use of this principle. For your response, answer the following questions:

* Name three specific visual signals (color, typeface, size, etc) that you see repeated throughout this site. Explain what each of these repeated signals communicate to the reader.
* How does the site use repetition to convey mood or character? What repeated elements of the site remind you of? How do they make you feel? Why?
* Name one thing this site does related to repetition that you might want to borrow for your own design, and explain why.

#### Inspiration Notebook Entry 4 (Due October 23)
This notebook entry focuses on the principle of _contrast_. Try to select a site that makes particularly striking use of this principle. For your response, answer the following questions:

* Name three specific examples of strong contrast employed in the site, and explain why the designer has chosen to make each of these three selected elements stand out in his or her design.
* How does the site use contrast to convey _visual hierarchy_? How have important pieces of information been contrasted with other elements to make them stand out? Why do you think these elements were selected by the designer to stand out?
* Name one thing this site does related to contrast that you might want to borrow for your own design, and explain why.  

### Evaluation:
Each notebook entry is worth 25% of the total inspiration notebook assignment grade. Each entry will be assigned from 0 to 25 points, based on the following formula:

* __Selected Site Quality (5 Points):__ The student will earn up to 5 points based on the quality of the site selected for his or her notebook entry. High quality sites clearly mark important information using visual cues (such as color and typeface), use visual proximity to organize information, and create a unified visual experience for the reader. Low-quality sites are ragged or disorganized, lack meaningful contrast cues, or are difficult for the user to navigate.
* __Selected Site Uniqueness (5 points):__ The student will earn up to 5 points based in the uniqueness of the site selected for his or her notebook entry. Unique sites use distinctive color and typeface choices, and unique placement of page elements, and integrate unique images into the larger design. Unique sites will effectively convey a mood and character appropriate to the site's purpose. Less unique sites use easily recognizable stock templates found in many locations throughout the web.
* __Prompt Questions (5 points each):__ The student will earn up to 5 points for his or her response to each of the prompt questions given for the notebook entry. For full credit, the response should be substantial (don't just say "I liked it" or "it was good," explain _why_) and should address specific design elements (dont just say "the design looked clean" explain _how_ it used color, contrast, etc. to achieve this).
