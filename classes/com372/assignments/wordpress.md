### Goals:
This assignment will give the student experience in using CSS to tweak and customize the design of a Wordpress site. This will give the student further experience writing CSS rules, and a better understanding of "real world" applications of CSS, in which designers are frequently called on to modify an existing web application by applying custom CSS>

### Instructions:
Students will install a new instance of wordpress on their reclaim hosting site, and be given an XML file with basic content. This content provides a textual outline of a congressional campaign website, with filler text by [Hipster Ipsum](http://hipsum.co/). Students will then work to create a custom _child theme_ for the site. This child theme must:

* Be based on one of the four following themes:
    * Twenty Fourteen
    * Twenty Fifteen
    * Radiant
    * Optimizer
* Use custom CSS to:
      * Create a distinct color scheme, noticeably different from the default color settings but appropriate to the site's purpose
      * Modify the layout of the theme in significant ways (i.e. changing the position of elements, resizing elements, changing the margin or paddding of elements) in ways that are noticeably different from the original design but still professional looking
      * Create a unique typographic appearance (employing appropriate google fonts and weight, size, and style properies) that is appropriate to the site's puropose

In addition, students will need to add to the site's content by:

* Adding appropriate images, either created by the student or drawn from creative-commons licensed images
* Adding a plug-in to enable users to contact the campaign (NOTE: This plugin should be styled in a unique way by your child theme)
