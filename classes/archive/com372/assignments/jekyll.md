### Goals
The goal of the Bootstrap project is to give students further experience building websites that incorporate the four design principles, and to let them practice using the Bootstrap tools for layout and responsive design.

###Instructions
Complete a Bootstrap based website (five pages or rows of content, minimum) on the topic of your choosing. Sync your Bootstrap based website to your github pages site for final evaluation.

### Evaluation:
The Jekyll Assignment will be evaluated according to the following rubric:

|Criteria:|Excellent|Good|Satisfactory|Needs Improvement|
|---------|---------|----|------------|-----------------|
|__Technical correctness:__  |The site's CSS is error free. The site is free of errors such as overflow or margin collapse. The site uses HTML and the bootstrap classes correctly.|The site's CSS and HTML are error free. The site is free of errors such as overflow or margin collapse. Small errors in the use of bootstrap classes (such as nesting issues) may exist, but do not cause significant problems for page content. |The site's CSS and HTML are error free. Bootstrap classes may be used incorrectly in ways that cause serious display issues on the page.|The site's CSS or HTML contain serious syntax errors.|
|__Design Consistency:__| The site is consistent in its style and layout choices. The user is able to easily find navigation elements, which appear in the same place in the layout of each page. Nothing "jumps" to a radically different location unexpectedly as the user navigates the site. All page elements are aligned consistently, and elements share margins to create columns and rows. The site's design is consistent with it's purpose, and sets a mood appropriate to its content. |The site uses consistent cues to convey visual hierarchy, but some small inconsistencies in layout may exist. Some elements may be misaligned, or may appear in slightly inconsistent locations from page to page. The overall impression is still one of neatness.|The site's design is "messy" with inconsistent color and font choices, inconsistent margins, or both.|The site's design is totally inconsistent and "messy". Large changes in color, layout, etc. happen from one page to the next in a way that confuses and surprises the reader.|
|__Design Uniqueness:__| The site uses unique color, font, and layout choices. The site's design is visually distinctive, and sets a mood consistent with its purpose.| The site establishes its uniqueness with some appropriate color or font choices, but does not employ a distinctive layout. The site's design sets a mood consistent with it's purpose, but may not have a lot of visual appeal.| The site's design conveys an appropriate mood, but it is hard for the reader to visually distinguish the site from the base styles included in Bootstrap.|The site's design is not appropriate to the its content.|
|__Design Hierarchy:__| The site uses size, color, weight, font and position to create contrast and emphasize important elements. The site organizes information spatially, using empty space to separate cohesive visual groupings of content. The site's methods for establishing hierarchy are unique to the site and add visual appeal.| The site uses size, color, weight, font and position to create contrast and emphasize important elements. The site organizes information spatially, using empty space to separate cohesive visual groupings of content.| The site attempts to use size, color, weight font, or position to establish visual hierarchy, but this attempt is not fully successful. The design may confuse the reader by using the same style to indicate different levels of hierarchy, overemphasize less important elements, or make similar mistakes.|The site makes no attempt to establish visual hierarchy.|
