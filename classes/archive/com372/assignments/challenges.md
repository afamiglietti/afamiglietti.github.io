### Goals:
The goal of the inspiration notebook is to give students experience using the html and css techniques covered in class.

### Instructions:
Over the course of the semester, students will complete 10 coding challenges. These are short coding tasks that will ask students to practice their html and css skills. Typically, students will have a week to complete a coding challenge.

### Evaluation:
Each challenge is worth 10% of the total coding challenge grade. Each challenge will be assigned from 0 to 10 points, based on the following formula:

* __Code Correctness (4 points)__: The code completed for your coding challenge must _validate_ using the html5 validator site.
* __Assigned Technique (4 points)__: The code completed for your coding challenge must correctly use the assigned html/css technique (for example, a list assignment must correctly use list tags and nesting).
* __Design Principles (2 points)__: Where applicable, the code should demonstrate the student's understanding of design principles.
