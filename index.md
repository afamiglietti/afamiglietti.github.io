###Andy Famiglietti:

is a teacher, developer and media scholar. He holds an American Culture Studies PhD from Bowling Green State University. He teaches Communications Ethics and Web Design at St. Joseph's University. He studies and writes about Wikipedia, Free Software, Copyright Law, and digitally-mediated culture. He hacks on Marca and organizes for the Calliope initiative in his spare time. He's getting pretty weirded out at referring to himself in the third person.     

Students, colleagues and other interested parties can check out the links below for more information about my research, teaching, and development work. If you want to get in touch with me, the best way is via email: afamiglietti at gmail dot com.
