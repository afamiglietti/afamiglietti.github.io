Andy Famiglietti is a teacher, developer and media scholar. He holds an American Culture Studies PhD from Bowling Green State University. He teaches Communications Ethics and Web Design at St. Joseph's University. He studies and writes about Wikipedia, Free Software, Copyright Law, and digitally-mediated culture. He hacks on Marca and organizes for the Calliope initiative in his spare time. He's getting pretty weirded out at referring to himself in the third person.
