Hello, and welcome to Copyvillain, the entirely modest web-presence of Andy Famiglietti. If you're confused about the name, it's something I came up with long ago, when intellectual property violations seemed much more revolutionary. I am an assistant professor of Digital Rhetoric at West Chester University, and I study and write about Wikipedia, Free Software, Copyright Law, and digitally-mediated rhetoric and communications. I hack on Marca and organize for the Calliope initiative in my spare time.

Students, colleagues and other interested parties can check out the links below for more information about my research, teaching, and development work. If you want to get in touch with me, the best way is via email: afamiglietti at gmail dot com.
