      <h3>Wikipedia</h3>
      My Wikipedia research centers around questions of organization, communication and power in the Wikipedia project. My contribution to the Institute of Network Cultures' <a href="http://networkcultures.org/blog/publication/critical-point-of-view-a-wikipedia-reader/">Critical Point of View</a> focused on the early relationship between Wikipedia and its potential competitor Gnupedia. I also described some of the rhetorical strategies employed by Wikipedia editors in <a href="http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4082/3294">First Monday</a>.

      <h3>Legal Research</h3>
      My contribution to the ongoing analysis of the intersection of Copyright Law and digital communications has focused on examining how maker/hacker culture has built on ideas previously explored in the Critical Legal Studies movement. I have published on these issues, along with my collaborator Tori Ekstrand, in <em>Cardozo Arts and Entertainment Law Journal</em> and <em>IDEA: The Intellectual Property Law Review</em>
