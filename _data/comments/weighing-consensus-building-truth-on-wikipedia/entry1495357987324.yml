message: "Do the Reds still have Elmore? Last news I saw was the Pirates claimed him off waivers. Why would the Reds let him go? Looks like he could have been the perfect back up shortstop for cheap at the very least. Maybe even take over at SS. Looking at minor league numbers comparing Elmore and Cozart, Elmore has superior on base skills. Sounds like it fills a need to me. Cozart may have the edge in power, but I would take more OBP over power given the Reds poor OBP.\r\nwhere to buy fake rolex mens black and blue watch http://www.crownuhr.nl/rolex-datejust-watches-c9/"
