  <p>In Ellen Ullman, in her excellent memoir <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/close-to-the-machine-technophilia-and-its-discontents-a-memoir/oclc/37277573&amp;referer=brief_results">Close  to the Machine</a>, describes an odd young man she briefly took up with  as an on-again off-again lover. Among his many obsessions was the  notion of creating a cryptographic currency, a wholly anonymous and  independent banking system. Well, it looks like someone has gone and  implemented this idea. The <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/">BitCoin</a> project "is a  peer-to-peer network based digital currency." It apparently derives its  backing from CPU processor cycles. I'm not exactly sure how that works,  but the Ron Paul-esque libertarian dreams of the creators are quite  clear in their description of the project's advantages: "Be safe from  the instability caused by fractional reserve banking and  bad policies  of central banks."</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure projects like this get <em>something </em>deeply wrong  about the social relationships that money relies on, but I'm not sure  exactly what. The individualist mindset that backs all this is suspect,  money relies on shared social relationships. However, the bitcoin folks clearly imagine a set  of relationships among individuals, in the form of the peer-to-peer  network. It is easy to explain why peer-to-peer networks do not describe  the world as it currently exists. It is more difficult to explain why  attempts to build them seem to inevitably fail.</p>
