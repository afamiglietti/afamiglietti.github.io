<h3 id="goals">Goals:</h3>
<p>The goal of the inspiration notebook is to build student knowledge of web design, and to provide them with a collection of high-quality design examples they can draw on as they build their own projects.</p>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions:</h3>
<p>Students will need to collect four examples of web design they find inspiring, and write up a short (300-500 word) document explaining why they believe each example to be a well designed web page. I have provided questions to guide your composition of each short response document. Your response document should also include the name of the website and a link to the website.</p>

<p>I <em>strongly recommend</em> that students spend some time finding good, unique examples for their inspiration notebooks. Investing the time to find well-designed and distinctive sites for this assignment vastly improves the student’s chances of producing well-designed and distinctive work of their own. The more variety you expose yourself to as you research your examples, the greater the palette of design options you will have at your disposal later on.</p>

<h4 id="inspiration-notebook-entry-1-due-september-23">Inspiration Notebook Entry 1 (Due September 23)</h4>
<p>This inspiration notebook entry focuses on color, typography, and visual hierarchy. Try to select a site that makes particularly striking use of these elements. For your response, answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How does the site use color and typography to convey a sense of mood or character? What do the colors used in the sites color scheme remind you of? How do they make you feel? Why? What do the site’s fonts remind you of?</li>
  <li>How does the site use color, typeface, type weight or other elements to convey <em>visual hierarchy</em>? What elements stand out from the body text of the page? What markers (color, typeface, type weight, etc.) make them stand out? Why do you think these elements were selected by the designer to stand out?</li>
  <li>Name one thing this site does related to color or typography that you might want to borrow for your own design, and explain why.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="inspiration-notebook-entry-2-due-october-2">Inspiration Notebook Entry 2 (Due October 2)</h4>
<p>This notebook entry focuses on layout (the placement of elements on the page) and navigation (the tools provided to the user to access various parts of the site). Try to select a site that makes particularly striking use of these elements. For your response, answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What page elements are placed near to one another on the page? What elements are separated from the others by large amounts of blank space? How does this grouping of elements help the user understand the organization of information on the page?</li>
  <li>Imagine a ruler being passed over the page both vertically and horizontally (if you wish, get a real ruler or fold a piece of paper and try it out for real). As the ruler passes over the page, what page elements does it connect on a shared vertical or horizontal line? How do these lines link related pieces of information, or help to unify the page composition?</li>
  <li>How has the designer directed attention to the <em>navigation elements</em> (links to other parts of the site) on the page? How do they help the user keep track of where they are on the site, and return back to previously visited material?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="inspiration-notebook-entry-3-due-october-16">Inspiration Notebook Entry 3 (Due October 16)</h4>
<p>You are free to choose any site that has a design you think worthy of emulating for this notebook entry. Try to choose something distinctive, something that looks noticeably different from your first two inspiration notebook entries.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is it about this page design that makes it unique? Describe the specific design elements (color, typeface, layout, etc.) that make the site stand out.</li>
  <li>How does the site use visual design (color, typeface, layout, etc.) do convey mood or character? What does the visual design of the site remind you of? How does it make you feel? Why?</li>
  <li>Name one thing this site does related to visual design that you might want to borrow for your own design, and explain why.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="inspiration-notebook-entry-4-due-october-23">Inspiration Notebook Entry 4 (Due October 23)</h4>
<p>You are free to choose any site that has a design you think worthy of emulating for this notebook entry. Try to choose something distinctive, something that looks noticeably different from your first two inspiration notebook entries.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is it about this page design that makes it unique? Describe the specific design elements (color, typeface, layout, etc.) that make the site stand out.</li>
  <li>How does the site use visual design (color, typeface, layout, etc.) do convey mood or character? What does the visual design of the site remind you of? How does it make you feel? Why?</li>
  <li>Name one thing this site does related to visual design that you might want to borrow for your own design, and explain why.  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation:</h3>
<p>Each notebook entry is worth 25% of the total inspiration notebook assignment grade. Each entry will be assigned from 0 to 25 points, based on the following formula:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Selected Site Quality (5 Points):</strong> The student will earn up to 5 points based on the quality of the site selected for his or her notebook entry. High quality sites clearly mark important information using visual cues (such as color and typeface), use visual proximity to organize information, and create a unified visual experience for the reader. Low-quality sites are ragged or disorganized, lack meaningful contrast cues, or are difficult for the user to navigate.</li>
  <li><strong>Selected Site Uniqueness (5 points):</strong> The student will earn up to 5 points based in the uniqueness of the site selected for his or her notebook entry. Unique sites use distinctive color and typeface choices, and unique placement of page elements, and integrate unique images into the larger design. Unique sites will effectively convey a mood and character appropriate to the site’s purpose. Less unique sites use easily recognizable stock templates found in many locations throughout the web.</li>
  <li><strong>Prompt Questions (5 points each):</strong> The student will earn up to 5 points for his or her response to each of the prompt questions given for the notebook entry. For full credit, the response should be substantial (don’t just say “I liked it” or “it was good,” explain <em>why</em>) and should address specific design elements (dont just say “the design looked clean” explain <em>how</em> it used color, contrast, etc. to achieve this).    </li>
</ul>
