      <h3>Web Design and Development: Overview</h3>
      This class is an introduction to the fundamentals of web design and development. No prior experience is necessary. Students will gain an understanding of the fundamental syntax of html and css, and the principles of design for the web environment. These basic literacies will help students understand how to organize information, and prepare them to design interactive multimedia texts using a variety of platforms and tools.
      <h3>Course Goals</h3>
      <p>
      After completing Com 372, students will:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand HTML and CSS syntax.</li>
        <li>Understand the roles of HTML and CSS in web design.</li>
        <li>Have experience using HTML and CSS to compose visual designs in three distinct environments (standard HTML files, Wordpress, and Jekyll).</li>
        <li>Have experience using visual cues to signal document structure to the reader.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Instructor Contact Information and Office Hours</h3>
      <p>
      The best way to contact me is to use my SJU email account: <a href="mailto:afamigli@sju.edu">afamigli@sju.edu</a>
      </p>
      <p>My office hours will be held on the first floor of Bronstein Hall (the communications department building) as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mondays from 1:30pm to 3pm</li>
        <li>Tuesdays from 11am to 1:00pm (free period)</li>
        <li>Wednesdays from 1:30pm to 3pm</li>
      </ul>
      If you can't make any of these times, and need to talk to me, contact me via email to set up an appointment.
      <h3>Course Policies</h3>
      Here are some things you need to know to succeed in this class:
      <h4>Ask for Help</h4>
      You will encounter problems. You will get stuck. You will be confused. This is part of the learning process, and cannot be avoided. If you encounter a technical problem, or find you cannot move forward on an assignment for any reason, reach out to me <em>immediately</em> and I will help you resolve the issue.
      <h4>Attendance Policy</h4>
      You are expected to be in class every day. The class moves quickly, and you will rapidly fall behind if you miss class. However, I understand that illness and other problems may happen. Each student is permitted three absences from class, no questions asked (don't mail me excuses or bring notes). If you exceed three absences, I will deduct 1/2 grade level from your final grade (i.e. An A becomes an A- a B+ becomes a B) for each additional absence. Students with more than 9 total absences are at risk of failing the class! <em>If you have a medical condition or sports conflict that requires you to miss more than three class meetings, you must set up a meeting with me to work out an individualized study plan that will allow you complete the work in this class successfully.</em>
      <h4>Plagiarism Policy</h4>
      In this class we will frequently consult example code, and sometimes reuse it, as a way to learn HTML and CSS techniques. However, students should not copy and paste example code from non-class sources as a method for completing assignments. You may consult outside example code, but should write your own code to complete the assignment and cement your understanding of the techniques being taught. Evidence that a student has simply copy-pasted outside example code to complete his or her work will result in a failing grade issued to the assignment in question.
      <h4>Official St. Joe's Title IX Statement</h4>
      <p>
      Saint Joseph’s University seeks to provide an environment that is free of bias, discrimination, and harassment.  If you have been the victim of sexual harassment/misconduct/assault we encourage you to report this.   If you report this to a faculty or staff member, she or he must notify the university’s Title IX Coordinator, Mary-Elaine Perry about the basic facts of the incident. The Title IX Coordinator will assist anyone making a report to connect with resources both on and off campus as well as making a determination regarding an investigation. If you would like to speak with the Title IX Coordinator directly, she can be reached at mperry01@sju.edu or 610-660-1145.
