<h3 id="goals">Goals:</h3>
<p>This assignment will give the student experience in using CSS to tweak and customize the design of a Wordpress site. This will give the student further experience writing CSS rules, and a better understanding of “real world” applications of CSS, in which designers are frequently called on to modify an existing web application by applying custom CSS.</p>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions:</h3>
<p>Students will install a new instance of wordpress on their reclaim hosting site, and be given an XML file with basic content. This content provides a textual outline of a congressional campaign website, with filler text by <a href="http://hipsum.co/">Hipster Ipsum</a>. Students will then work to create a custom <em>child theme</em> for the site. This child theme must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be based on one of the four following themes:
    <ul>
      <li>Twenty Fourteen</li>
      <li>Twenty Fifteen</li>
      <li>Radiant</li>
      <li>Optimizer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use custom CSS to:
    <ul>
      <li>Create a distinct color scheme, noticeably different from the default color settings but appropriate to the site’s purpose</li>
      <li>Modify the layout of the theme in significant ways (i.e. changing the position of elements, resizing elements, changing the margin or paddding of elements) in ways that are noticeably different from the original design but still professional looking</li>
      <li>Create a unique typographic appearance (employing appropriate google fonts and weight, size, and style properies) that is appropriate to the site’s purpose</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, students will need to add to the site’s content by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adding appropriate images, either created by the student or drawn from creative-commons licensed images</li>
  <li>Adding a plug-in to enable users to contact the campaign (NOTE: This plugin should be styled in a unique way by your child theme)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation:</h3>
<p>The Wordpress Assignment will be evaluated according to the following rubric:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Criteria:</th>
      <th>Excellent</th>
      <th>Good</th>
      <th>Satisfactory</th>
      <th>Needs Improvement</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Technical correctness:</strong></td>
      <td>The site’s CSS is error free. The site is free of errors such as overflow or margin collapse. The alignment of repositioned elements has been preserved.</td>
      <td>The site’s CSS is error free. The site is free of errors such as overflow or margin collapse. Small alignment issues may exist.</td>
      <td>TThe site’s CSS is error free. Small alignment errors, or issues such as overflow or collapsed margins may exist.</td>
      <td>The site’s CSS contains serious syntax errors.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Design Consistency:</strong></td>
      <td>The site’s design is consistent with it’s purpose, clearly conveying emotions appropriate to a political campaign. In addition, consistent visual cues are used to signal visual hierarchy across the design.</td>
      <td>The site uses consistent cues to convey visual hierarchy, but some small elements may seem out of place, given the site’s purpose.</td>
      <td>The site’s design is neat, but not really appropriate to the purpose of a political campaign.</td>
      <td>The site’s design is not professional, and could undercut the credibility of the candidate.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Design Uniqueness:</strong></td>
      <td>The site uses unique color, font, and layout choices. The site’s design is visually distinctive, and strikingly different from the base theme.</td>
      <td>The site’s design sets an appropriate mood for the given content, and makes an attempt to distinguish itself from the base theme, but is not really distinctive.</td>
      <td>The site’s design conveys an appropriate mood, but it is hard for the reader to visually distinguish the site from the base theme.</td>
      <td>The site’s design is not appropriate to the given content.</td>
