      <h3>Critical Hacking and Making: Overview</h3>
      This class is about both learning and engaging with the history and politics of technology. We will learn to use Hacker/Maker derived technologies, like the Arduino microcontroller and 3d printers, and we will learn about the cultural values Hackers tried to "bake in" to these technologies. To better understand the cultural values at play, we will investigate the history of Hacker culture. Our class will read some case studies of Hacker/Maker projects that have tried to use technology to shape social change. Finally, we will work together as a class to build our own Hacker/Maker techno-social project.
      <h3>Course Goals</h3>
      <p>
      After completing Com 473, students will:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be able to identify key values informing Hacker/Maker culture</li>
        <li>Be able to describe how Hacker/Maker culture has evolved over its history</li>
        <li>Be able to articulate how Hacker/Maker values inform the design of technologies like the Arduino and 3d Printer</li>
        <li>Be able to write simple programs for the Arduino microcontroller</li>
        <li>Be able to build simple objects with a 3d printer</li>
        <li>Be able to use Arduino microcontrollers and 3d printed objects to build devices that accomplish social and political goals</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Instructor Contact Information and Office Hours</h3>
      <p>
      The best way to contact me is to use my SJU email account: <a href="mailto:afamigli@sju.edu">afamigli@sju.edu</a>
      </p>
      <p>My office hours will be held on the first floor of Bronstein Hall (the communications department building) as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mondays from 1:30pm to 3pm</li>
        <li>Tuesdays from 11am to 1pm (free period)</li>
        <li>Wednesdays from 1:30pm to 3pm</li>
      </ul>
      If you can't make any of these times, and need to talk to me, contact me via email to set up an appointment.
      <h3>Course Policies</h3>
      Here are some things you need to know to succeed in this class:
      <h4>Ask for Help</h4>
      You will encounter problems. You will get stuck. You will be confused. This is part of the learning process, and cannot be avoided. If you encounter a technical problem, or find you cannot move forward on an assignment for any reason, reach out to me <em>immediately</em> and I will help you resolve the issue.
      <h4>Attendance Policy</h4>
      You are expected to be in class every day. The class moves quickly, and you will rapidly fall behind if you miss class. However, I understand that illness and other problems may happen. Each student is permitted three absences from class, no questions asked (don't mail me excuses or bring notes). If you exceed three absences, I will deduct 1/2 grade level from your final grade (i.e. An A becomes an A- a B+ becomes a B) for each additional absence. Students with more than 9 total absences are at risk of failing the class! <em>If you have a medical condition or sports conflict that requires you to miss more than three class meetings, you must set up a meeting with me to work out an individualized study plan that will allow you complete the work in this class successfully.</em>
      <h4>Plagiarism Policy</h4>
      In this class we will frequently consult example code, and sometimes reuse it, as a way to learn HTML and CSS techniques. However, students should not copy and paste example code from non-class sources as a method for completing assignments. You may consult outside example code, but should write your own code to complete the assignment and cement your understanding of the techniques being taught. Evidence that a student has simply copy-pasted outside example code to complete his or her work will result in a failing grade issued to the assignment in question.
      <h4>Official St. Joe's Title IX Statement</h4>
      <p>
      Saint Joseph’s University seeks to provide an environment that is free of bias, discrimination, and harassment.  If you have been the victim of sexual harassment/misconduct/assault we encourage you to report this.   If you report this to a faculty or staff member, she or he must notify the university’s Title IX Coordinator, Mary-Elaine Perry about the basic facts of the incident. The Title IX Coordinator will assist anyone making a report to connect with resources both on and off campus as well as making a determination regarding an investigation. If you would like to speak with the Title IX Coordinator directly, she can be reached at mperry01@sju.edu or 610-660-1145.
