<h3 id="goals">Goals:</h3>

<p>The classroom notes assignment serves to improve student’s active reading skills, and assist their comprehension and retention of class texts.</p>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions:</h3>

<p>Prior to our second class meeting (Wednesday, August 26) create a google document and share this document with the professor’s google account (afamiglietti at gmail dot com). If you do not know how to create and share a google document, refer to this video.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EKt3-fruLyE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>You will use this Google doc to complete short responses for most of our class readings. The prompts for these readings are listed on the <a href="/classes/com201/calendar.html">class calendar</a>. You should write about 150-300 words in response to each prompt.</p>

<p>You <em>must</em> complete your response to the given prompt prior to 9pm the night <em>before</em> the class meeting listed on the calendar. This will give me a chance to review your response prior to the class meeting, and prepare the day’s discussion accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation:</h3>

<p>Each response will be awarded 2 points, 1 point or 0 points, based on the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>2 Points:</strong> The response shows me that the student has carefully read the assigned reading. It is written in the student’s own words, completely addresses the assigned prompt and is 150-300 words in length.</li>
  <li><strong>1 point:</strong> The response suggests the student has not devoted time or effort to the assigned reading. It is less than 150 words long, fails to address all of the elements of the prompt, or consists largely of material copy-pasted from the source.</li>
  <li><strong>0 points:</strong> The response was not completed on time, does not address the prompt, or does not use the student’s own words. </li>
</ul>

<p>The points awarded for the combined responses will be tallied up to determine the assignment score at the end of the semester. I will drop the 3 lowest scoring posts when computing the final score.</p>
