<h2>Mashup Assignment</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Due:</strong> September 18, 2015</li>
  <li><strong>Worth:</strong> 10% of total grade</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h3 id="goals">Goals:</h3>
<p>The goal of the mashup assignment is to give students hands-on experience with the mash-up form, so they can better understand the ethical challenges that we face when remixing the work of others.</p>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions:</h3>
<p>Working along with 3-4 classmates, create an original mashup or remix. This mashup or remix can use any medium you like (audio remix, video mash-up, image modification, etc.). The mashup may also address any topic you like (though you should consider the ethical question of exposing your classmates to material that might traumatize them when selecting a topic). The mashup must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Incorporate the prior work of at least 3 other creators (photographers, filmmakers, musicians, poets, etc.)</li>
  <li>Substantially <em>transform</em> the incorporated work</li>
  <li>Use the the transformed work to accomplish some sort of expressive/communicative goal (expressing something about contemporary life, making a political argument, exploring an ethical question, etc.)</li>
  <li>Plausibly represent <em>at least</em> 3 hours of active work (composing, planning, editing, mixing, etc.) per student  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="mashup-reflection">Mashup reflection</h4>
<p>Once you have completed your mashup, you must compose a short (300-600 word) reflection on your experience. The reflection should address the ethical questions encountered by your group in creating your mashup, and explain how you resolved them. Consider the following as you compose your reflection:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Were you able to <em>attribute</em> the other authors of the work you re-used? Why or why not?</li>
  <li>Do you think the original author would have approved of the new use you found for their work? Why or why not?</li>
  <li>Do you think your re-use is likely to have a negative influence on the income of the authors of the original work? Why or why not?</li>
  <li>Do you think you could have expressed your idea using another form, rather than a mashup? Should you have? Why or why not?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation:</h3>
<p>Half of the score of the mashup assignment will be based on the mashup itself, and half will be based on the reflection. The criteria used to score the mashup and reflection are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mashup Originality (25 points)</strong>: Mashups that radically transform the work they reuse will be awarded 25 points, with less original work being awarded fewer points.</li>
  <li><strong>Mashup Expressiveness (25 points)</strong>: Mashups that clearly express an idea to the audience (as judged by audience reaction during our mashup sharing day) will be awarded 25 points. If the audience is unsure of what you were trying to say, fewer points will be awarded.</li>
  <li><strong>Reflection Clarity (25 points)</strong>: Reflections composed in clear, grammatically correct sentences organized into clear, coherent paragraphs will be awarded 25 points. Unclear reflections will be awarded fewer points.</li>
  <li><strong>Reflection Substance (25 points)</strong>: Reflections that substantially address the prompts given in the assignment and demonstrate a deep knowledge of the issues discussed in class will be awarded 25 points. Reflections that show only a surface knowledge of class readings, or that fail to address the prompts, will be awarded fewer points. </li>
</ul>
