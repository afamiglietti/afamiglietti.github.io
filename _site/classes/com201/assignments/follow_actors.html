<h3 id="goals">Goals:</h3>
<p>The goal of the Follow The Actors assignment is to build student knowledge of the larger networks of human and non-human actors that are connected by everyday technologies. To accomplish this, students will write a short essay describing the background of a technological artifact, and explaining how this background has ethical implications.</p>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions:</h3>
<p>Choose any artifact (technological device) in your everyday life. Write a brief (750-900 word, about 3 pages of doublespaced material) essay describing the composition of this artifact. Your essay should draw from <em>at least</em> three scholarly sources (i.e. NOT wikipedia or random blogs) and be organized into the following sections:</p>

<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Introduce your artifact and provide a “roadmap” telling the reader what to expect in the remaining sections.</p>

<h4 id="artifact-background">Artifact Background</h4>
<p>Summarize your artifact’s background. Who designed it? Why? What components does it depend on? What networks of trade/power/information is it connected to? (NOTE: this material should not reproduce exitsting summaries of the artifact’s background, as found on Wikipedia or elsewhere, but should highlight the parts of the device’s history and construction relevant to the next section).</p>

<h4 id="ethical-implications">Ethical Implications</h4>
<p>Explain the ethical questions or problems that examining the device’s construction reveals. How do the device’s history, components, and networks create potentially negative effects on others, both human and non-human? Why might we not see these effects in our everyday use of the device? What do you think this means for your own use of the device?</p>

<td align="left"><strong>Argument</strong></td>
<td align="left">The student makes an original and logical argument about the ethical implications of their chosen device, and shows how this argument connects to the device's background.</td>
<td align="left">The student makes a clear argument, but does not clearly connect this argument to the device's background.</td>
<td align="left">The student attempts to build an argument, but flaws in logic, unclear claims, or fundamental misunderstandings of class ideas undermine this argument.</td>
<td align="left">The student does not attempt to build an argument of his or her own, instead simply rephrasing the thought of others.</td>

<td align="left"><strong>Evidence</strong></td>
<td align="left">The student uses specific references to at least three scholarly sources. The evidence selected is clearly connected to the argument being made and logically incorporated into a well-structured paragraph. The evidence selected demonstrates the student&#8217;s mastery of class concepts.</td>
<td align="left">The student uses specific references to at least three scholarly sources. However, this evidence is incorporated in a clumsy manner that fails to make clear connections to the student&#8217;s argument.</td>
<td align="left">The student attempts to use evidence from three scholarly sources, but this attempt is not fully successful. The student may have failed to integrate the quote into his or her text, fundamentally misunderstood class readings or misquoted the author.</td>
<td align="left">The student fails to utilize specific evidence from the scholarly sources in his or her response.</td>

<td align="left"><strong>Style</strong></td>
<td align="left">The student&#8217;s response is clearly composed, free of errors that distract from understanding, and uses language and style choices in a way consistent with the format given in the prompt.</td>

<td align="left">The student&#8217;s response contains significant errors that distract from understanding, or is totally inconsistent with the format given in the prompt.</td>
<td align="left">The student&#8217;s response suggests he or she put little or no effort into composing and proofreading his or her response.</td>
