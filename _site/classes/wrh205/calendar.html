    <p>
    If you're reading this, then the <a href="http://www.apscuf.org/">faculty</a> and administration of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education have failed to reach a
    <a href="http://www.apscuf.org/news-center/strike">fair contract agreement</a>, and I am on strike. My classes are not being taught today. Here's what you should know:
  </p>
    <h2>For my students</h2>
    <p>I want you to know that I am on strike to protect our shared future. First, our strike centers around protecting the quality of your education, by preventing changes that would
    <a href="http://www.apscuf.org/images/PDFs/students/studentFactSheet092816.pdf">undermine educational quality</a> across the PASSHE system. However, equally importantly, I believe that we
    must strike to <em>fight back against the erosion of fair employment in all sorts of jobs.</em> The state system wants to <a href="http://ragingchickenpress.org/2016/06/27/why-the-apscuf-contracts-treatment-of-adjunct-faculty-matters-to-tenure-line-faculty/">
    replace permanent, stable faculty jobs with what
    are called adjunct positions</a>. Adjunct instructors are often just as well qualified as permanent faculty, but they teach longer hours for much lower wages, and they lack job security from one
    semester to the next. Many adjuncts struggle to make ends meet, and some even <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/An-Adjuncts-Death-Becomes-a/141709/">lack basic necessities</a>. The
    move to replace permanent faculty with adjuncts is not limited to PASSHE, far from it. In fact, adjunct positions now make up a
    <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/11/adjunct-faculty_n_4255139.html">majority of faculty jobs</a> at colleges and universities in the United States.
  </p>
    <p>
      This move to replace permanent employees with contingent workers, hired on short-term contracts, is happening across all sectors of the economy. Forbes magazine (that well known leftist rag)
      reports that a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/elainepofeldt/2015/05/25/shocker-40-of-workers-now-have-contingent-jobs-says-u-s-government/#3fe182192532">full 40% of workers are now
      contingent.</a> If you are a college student today, this trend should concern you. The move to replace permanent employees with contingent workers directly diminishes your opportunity to find
      a stable job with health benefits and the sort of salary that will allow you to own a home, raise a family, or pursue whatever your vision for a fulfilling life is.<em> I am on strike to
      do my part to fight against a future where you will be thrown into a "gig economy," and expected to hustle from one temporary position to another, never able to build a life or a home.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The why question aside, I'm sure many of you are wondering <strong>should I come to class today?</strong> I know that the administrators have been telling you to attend classes during the strike,
      threatening you will be marked absent if you do not. I believe this is an empty threat. It is extremely unlikely that faculty will punish students for absence reports made by others when
      we return to work. You should feel free to stay home from classes or even, if you wish, join your instructors on the picket line.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, if you need to contact me, do so at my personal email address: <a href="mailto:afamiglietti@gmail.com">afamiglietti@gmail.com</a>. I'll see you when all this is over.
    </p>
    <h2>For everyone else</h2>
    <p>I know many of my friends and colleagues are as passionate about fairness for contingent faculty (and all workers!) as I am, and I ask you for your support. Please spread your messages of
    solidarity with our cause on social media under the hashtag <strong>#withAPSCUF.</strong> You may also want to <a href="https://actionsprout.io/722096/initial">sign our petition.</a> Thanks for your help!
