<p>Author's main question: "how can we understand [sites like Wikipedia] in their traditional role as continuation of  the Enlightenment ideal, as well as situated and embedded in the  distinctly different space of online networks?"</p>
<p>Massive oversimplification of actual Wikipedia editing process: "It describes itself as the encyclopaedia that “anyone can edit” <a name="4a"></a>[4],  and this is exactly how it works. Anybody who is online can contribute  to <em>Wikipedia’s</em> content and structure."</p>
<p>Only true for a very limited definition of "anonymous:" "The writers can chose to be entirely anonymous"</p>
